\[A#m]When a humble bard
\[D#]Graced a ride along
\[D#m]With Geralt of \[Fm]Rivia
Along came \[E&sus2]this \[Fm]song \[F]
 
 
     Eb             Eb7
From when the White Wolf fought
                 Ab
A silver-tongued devil
Ab
His army of elves
                  Eb   Ab    F  Bbm
At his hooves did they revel
 
 
      Eb       Eb7
They came after me
  Eb            Gb
With masterful deceit
              Db
Broke down my lute
Db                    Bbm
And they kicked in my teeth
 
 
Eb                Eb7
While the devil’s horns
                  Gb
Minced our tender meat
                 Ab
And so cried the Witcher
Ab                 Bbm
He can’t be bleat
 
 
[Chorus]
Bbm    F                   Eb
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb           Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’
 
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to Your Witcher
Eb           F       A  Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
 
[Verse 2]
Bbm                Eb
At the edge of the world
                 Gb
Fight the mighty horde
                Ab
That bashes and breaks you
                  Eb     Ab  F  Bbm
And brings you to mourn
 
 
Bbm             Gbm
He thrust every elf
                G
Far back on the shelf
               Ab
High up on the mountain
               Eb    Ab  F  Bbm
From whence it came
 
 
Bbm               Eb
He wiped out your pest
                  Gb
Got kicked in his chest
                  Ab
He’s a friend of humanity
   F            Bbm
So give him the rest
 
 
Bbm            Eb
That’s my epic tale
             Gb
Our champion prevailed
             Ab
Defeated the villain
Ab
Now pour him some ale
 
[Chorus]
Bbm    F            Db   Eb
Toss a coin to your Witcher
             Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Eb           Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’
 
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb            F          Db  F  Bbm
And friend of humanity
 
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb           Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’
 
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb            F        A Bbm
And friend of humanity
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb           Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’ Valley of Plenty
Bbm
O’
 
Bbm    F            Db
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Eb            F        A Bb
And friend of humanity
